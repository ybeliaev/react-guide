# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Ignite

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

### Problem - "has been blocked by CORS policy". I use key API, but nothing..(don't get detail info about games)
